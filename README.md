# Cohort-Project: Customer-Churn-Analysis
The project focuses on building predictive models to identify customers that are at the risk of churning. Customer churn is a major challenge for telecommunication companies, as it represents customers loss to competitors. Costs associated with getting new customers often exceed cost of retaining existing ones, making it crucial to reduce churn.
